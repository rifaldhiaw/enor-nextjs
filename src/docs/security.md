Building an app that meets security and privacy standards involves a number of different measures. Here are some steps you can take to ensure the security and privacy of your app:

1. **Use secure servers:**  
   Make sure that the servers your app is hosted on are secure and meet industry standards for data protection.

2. **Encrypt data:**  
   Use encryption to protect sensitive data, both in transit and at rest.

3. **Use secure coding practices:**  
   Follow best practices for secure coding to prevent vulnerabilities in your app.

4. **Implement authentication and authorization:**  
   Use authentication to verify the identity of users and authorization to control access to resources within the app.

5. **Use third-party security tools:**  
   Use tools like firewalls and intrusion detection systems to add an extra layer of security to your app.

6. **Conduct regular security assessments:**  
   Regularly assess the security of your app to identify and fix any vulnerabilities.

7. **Educate users:**  
   Make sure that users of your app are aware of the importance of security and privacy, and educate them on how to protect their data.

8. **Comply with relevant regulations:**  
   Make sure that your app complies with any relevant privacy laws and regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union.
