Here is an MVP of an app where someone can build their startup, with HR management and team collaboration features:

1. User authentication:  
   Users should be able to create accounts and log in to the app.

2. Job posting and applicant tracking:  
   Users should be able to create job listings, review applications, and track the status of candidates.

3. Employee profiles and payroll management:  
   Users should be able to create profiles for employees and manage their payroll, including tracking time worked, calculating pay, and generating pay stubs.

4. Team collaboration:  
   Users should be able to communicate with each other and collaborate on tasks within the app, including features such as real-time messaging, file sharing, and video conferencing.

5. Project management:  
   Users should be able to track progress on tasks, assign tasks to team members, and manage deadlines using tools such as calendars and task lists.

6. Integration with other tools:  
   The app should be able to integrate with other tools and platforms that the team uses, such as project management software or file-sharing platforms.

7. Mobile app:  
   The app should have a mobile version that allows users to access the app from their smartphones or tablets.

By including these features, the app can provide a comprehensive HR management and team collaboration platform for startups, allowing users to efficiently manage their team and work on their product.
